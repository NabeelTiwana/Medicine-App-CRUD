This C++ program represents a simple medical store inventory management system. It allows users to perform various operations such as adding, deleting, updating, searching, and viewing items in the inventory. The items in the inventory are represented by their ID, name, price, and quantity. The program uses parallel arrays to store the information of each item, and users can interact with the system through a menu-driven interface.
